# Langton's Ant

Langton's Ant is a cellular automaton that follows simple rules yet exhibits complex behavior. It operates on a grid of black and white cells where an "ant" moves according to the color of the cell it occupies. The rules are as follows:

- If the ant is on a black cell, it turns 90 degrees right, flips the color of the cell to white, and moves forward.
- If the ant is on a white cell, it turns 90 degrees left, flips the color of the cell to black, and moves forward.

Despite these simple rules, Langton's Ant can create highly intricate patterns over time, making it a fascinating example of emergent behavior in computational systems.
